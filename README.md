# lab-01

In lab today, you will be building a single responsive web page based off of the provided design comp assets. These contain images of what you are striving to build in HTML and CSS, so be sure to open them up and keep them handy, but note that they are not for actual use on the page. You can also print out these comps and use them to mark up and sketch out page structure.

Your document must be designed in a mobile-first approach and must be responsive when the screen size changes and the page is refreshed. The details of the media query specifications are up to you, but your breakpoint must be at 768 pixels.

This is an independent project, but your are free to collaborate with your classmates.

Feature #1: Responsive design
Why are we implementing this feature?
As a user, I want the dimensions and colors of the application to change so that I can have a unique view in desktop, mobile, and tablet viewports.
What are we going to implement?
Given that a user opens the application in the browser, on a tablet, or on a mobile device
When the user changes the size of the viewport
Then the boxes should scale proportionally and change colors

How are we implementing it?
Use Flexbox or CSS grids for styling this application.
Use relative units so the elements scale proportionally when the viewport dimensions change.
Use at least two breakpoints and change the background colors of each box. There should be three possible views: desktop, tablet, and mobile device. You may choose the exact pixel values for each breakpoint.
